Description: A XSLT debugging/execution tool at console like gdb
 xsldbg is a text based tool to debug stylesheets (the eXtensible Stylesheet Language) and has commands   similar to the Unix/Linux debugger gdb. 
 It has three major modes of execution of stylesheets.
   o Run the whole stylesheet
   o Step to the next XSLT instruction
   o Continue until next break point is found, or the stylesheet has restarted
