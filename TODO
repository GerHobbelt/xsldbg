Copies of emails about TODO's/Bugs

Hi Keith,

 I added a page t omy web site :
 http://elbobby.free.fr/xslt/xsldbg-en.html in english and
 http://elbobby.free.fr/xslt/xsldbg.html in french.

 the xsldbg package has a little problem since in the xsldbg shell, it search
 html file in /opt/kde3 and not in /usr/docs. Try to correct that ASAP.

 Regard.

Hi Robert,

 Thanks I'll look at the problem mentioned (docs not copying to $(KDEDIR), though I'm not sure which
 file(s) are the problem in what directory. I've intended that the docs
 ge installed using either the macro variable $(HTML_DIR) or $(KDEDIR)
 see
 http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-
 bin/viewcvs.cgi/xsldbg/xsldbg/configure.in?rev=1.52&content-
 type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

 and

 http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-
 bin/viewcvs.cgi/xsldbg/xsldbg/docs/en/KDE/Makefile.am?rev=1.12&content-
 type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

 A screen dump of when the error occured would be appreciated and help
 clarify where things are going wrong.

 I'm puzzled by the comment on your site about xsldbg

 This should not be the case. Only if you want to build qxsldbg do you
 need qt2/qt3. If you don't specify --enable-xsldbgthread when
 configuring xsldbg, there is/should not be a requirement to have
 qt2/qt3.

 Also

 I agree this needs rework but I'm not sure how better to present this
 information. The only other way I can think of is use lots of little
 windows which I find annoying. (ie one window for each). I guess I
 could have a separate window to contain xsldbg/libxslt configuration.

 And

 This is resolved in qxsldbg-0.6 which is a cvs only release (very alpha
 software). It is hoped to have a beta version of qxsldbg which has this
 feature some time in August (after my final exams)

 And

 Yes this could to be fixed with an error mesage displayed in a popup
 window. There would have been an error mesaged printed to the data
 inspector's text area (this text area captures all of the text output
 from xsldbg). This is because libxslt can't run without a data file and
 xsldbg interupts the operation of libxslt. Try the same thing with
 xsldbg and you'll see what I mean.

 I'll hold off updating my site with the links mention until I'm sure
 issues that you are aware of, that can be quickly fixed, of have been
 fixed. It is my intention to make a new cvs release for xsldbg to fix
 the bugs indentified.

 Regards,

 Keith Isdale

  Hum, sounds simple, would cost nothing at run-time. Potential TODO, yes.
