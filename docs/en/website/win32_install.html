<h1>xsldbg Installation for win32</h1>

<pre>

xsldbg will ONLY compile when using static libraries there are some exports that still need to be setup
. And you probably will need to change the include and library paths to suit your configuration.
Use batch build to select the static libraries.

First copy the files from win32/dsp/libxml2_new_files and replace those in
  &lt; GNOME-XML &gt;/win32/dsp

Build gnome-xml.

Then copy the files from win32/dsp/libxslt_new_files and replace those in
  &lt; LIBXSLT &gt;/win32/dsp

Build libxslt.

Warning! Make sure that there is a /D "WITH_DEBUGGER" in your compile options otherwise xsldbg will
NOT work.

Build xsldbg and run xsldbg without any arguments. See index.html

It is required that xsldbg, be in your system PATH. Also you need to setup your xml catalogs using xmlcatalog otherwise
you will get warnings when running searches.

You should setup the XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to point to your xml catalog. And add search.dtd and xmldoc.dtd to you xml catalog.
Also you should also set the XSLDBG_DOCS_DIR environment variable to point to &lt; XSLDBG &gt;/docs/en/
