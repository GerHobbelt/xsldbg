* Keith Isdale 20 Nov 2001
* Added file breakpoint/breakpointInternals.h to libxslt
*   Put all the declarations of potential useful internal breakpoint functions 
*   in 	breakpointInternals.h
* Added to the breakpoint API (breakpoint/breakpointInternals.h) the internal search 
*	functions of :
*  	     searchInit, searchFree, searchDoc, seachRootNode, 
*	    searchBreakPointNode,  searchTemplateNode, searchCallStackNode
* Added to the breakpoint API (breakpoint/breakpoint.h)the public search 
*	functions of :
	    xslSeachEmpty, xslSearchSave, xslSeachAdd, xslFindNodesByQuery

*	breakpoint directory.
* Fix many errors detected by even more pandatic compiler settings
* Added macros :
*	    xmlStrLen, xmlStrCat, xmlStrCpy
*   to xsldbg.h to handle (xmlChar*) input instead of (char*)
*     They still end up calling  the standard string functions
* Removed the "root" command line parameter instead xsldbg automatically 
*	stops and first xsl node found after stepping into stylesheet
* Fixed errors in logic for recovering when files can't be loaded
*       in xsldbg.c main	
	

	
* Keith Isdale 19 Nov 2001
* Added automatic replacement of '~' for $HOME environment variable value
*         when using source and data commands
* Added xslEmptyBreakPoint to breakpoint API
* Did a trial run of importing breakpoint API implementation into

*       are not met	
*   Ported new xsltproc code into xsldbg.c
*   Added xslDebugBreak to dbgmain.c 	
*   Fix many minor errors detected by setting pandantic compiler flags
* Changed source and data commands so that a "run" is required after

* Added test8 to run xsldbg on docbook.xsl
* Cleaned up breakpoint API source
	
* Keith Isdale 18 Nov 2001

* Keith Isdale 11 Nov 2001
* Separated parameter storage from xsldbg.c and put into options.[ch]

*	 file name 
* Added	implementation for array list via arraylist.h, dbgarraylist.c

* taged repository to rel-0-6-4

*Keith Isdale 7 Nov 2001

* Keith Isdale 3 Nov 2001
* k_isdale@tpg.com.au
* Version 0.6.4	
* Ported xsldbg to use  xmlNoNetExternalEntityLoader in libxml 
*	(xsldbg.c is a rehash of /xsltproc/xsltproc.c in libxslt)
*	
* Split breakpoint API into several small files of cohesive functions
*	
* Change libxslt to supply blank implementation of breakpoint API which I 
*   then override in xsldbg (see files src/dbg*.c)
*   files affected in libxslt are
* 	/configure.in, /Makefile.am, /breakpoints/*.[ch]  	
*
*	Adapt /configure.in to abort if debugger support not built into libxslt
*	
* Keith Isdale 1 Nov 2001

* Added tests directory and build a framework for automated testing
*	see results directory for the intermediate outputs of testing
* Added function xslDebugGotControl to breakpoint API (see /breakpoint/dbgmain.c)
