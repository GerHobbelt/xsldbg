Keith Isdale 6 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
Fixed inconsitancies in src/*.h	
    o ensure that enums are declared that same way, made use of 
	enums rather that using int's and have a unique range of values
	(where possible). 
    o ensure that enums values are accesed via a temporary int variable. This
 	is to ensure there are no compiler problems. I've previous experienced
	problems where you can't do a switch on a enum value.
    o	Added enum types of
	  BreakPointTypeEnum, FileTypeEnum, WalkSpeedEnum, 
	  OptionTypeEnum, TraceModeEnum, CommandsEnum

    o fix spelling of "Return :" to "Returns :"

	needed 
    o fixed the spelling of guessStyleSheetHelper* to 
	 guessStylesheetHelper*

	be consistant with rest of project. They now are 
		topDocument, tempDocument,topStylesheet
   o fixed spelling of getTemporarDoc to getTemporaryDoc
   o fixed logic of xsldbg.c so that when debugging stylesheets
	we start up in a xslDebugStatus of DEBUG_STOP
   o fixed spelling of xsldbgSleep to xslDbgSleep
   o ensure all functions have a fully described declaration
	near the start of most *.c files is the declations of
	its private functions

       use the hard limit of 8 parameters  for the moment	
 Added the ability to choose xml and stylesheet file from xsldbg prompt
 Made debugging default, if no parameters are given to xsldbg than it
      goes straight to xsldbg command prompt

 Version 0.6.4	
 Ported xsldbg to use  xmlNoNetExternalEntityLoader in libxml 
	(xsldbg.c is a rehash of /xsltproc/xsltproc.c in libxslt)
	
 Split breakpoint API into several small files of cohesive functions
	
 Change libxslt to supply blank implementation of breakpoint API which I 
   then override in xsldbg (see files src/dbg*.c)
   files affected in libxslt are
 	/configure.in, /Makefile.am, /breakpoints/*.[ch]  	

	Adapt /configure.in to abort if debugger support not built into libxslt

 Changed xslDbgPrintTemplateNames so that the order of printing templates so
	it matches the order it is in file 

 Added tests directory and build a framework for automated testing
	see results directory for the intermediate outputs of testing
 Added function xslDebugGotControl to breakpoint API (see /breakpoint/dbgmain.c)
