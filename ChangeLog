* k_isdale@tpg.com.au
* Version 0.6.4	
* Ported xsldbg to use  xmlNoNetExternalEntityLoader in libxml 
*	(xsldbg.c is a rehash of /xsltproc/xsltproc.c in libxslt)
*	
* Split breakpoint API into several small files of cohesive functions
*	
* Change libxslt to supply blank implementation of breakpoint API which I 
*   then override in xsldbg (see files src/dbg*.c)
*   files affected in libxslt are
* 	/configure.in, /Makefile.am, /breakpoints/*.[ch]  	
*
*	Adapt /configure.in to abort if debugger support not built into libxslt
