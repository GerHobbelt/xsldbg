    4.6.1
    Fixes
        Fix walking, tracing command logic.
	Output of templates command when multiple XSLT documents are present
        Correct logic that guesses relative XSLT file path given to 'break' command (needed debugging http/ftp documents)
        Correct logic of output of 'templates' command with '-q' option
        Remove useless 'this' option to 'templates' command
    Features
        To improve UI in qxslbg emit XsldbgDebuggerBase::completeTransform() signal when completed XSLT tranformation
        'entities' command output now in two new forms with "<ID>"values now quoted
            Enties PublicID:"<ID>" SystemID:"<ID>"
            Enties SystemID:"<ID>"
        'entities' command output now support '-r' argument that prints resolved URI for entity
            Enties PublicID:"<ID>" SystemID:"<ID>" URI:"<URI>"
            Enties SystemID:"<ID>" URI:"<URI>"
        Update XsldbgDebuggerBase to emit the resolved URI of entities
        Add tests for walk and trace commands
	Add test for http:// and ftp:// XML/XSLT document paths
	Only print "Reached template" when XSLT match or mode has changed
	Sort breakpoints by ID
        Sort templates by file and line number
        The <match> option to 'templates' command will match template whose name *contains* <match>

Keith Isdale 1st Jan 2004 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Vesion 3.1.8
  Disable DocBook SGML parsing as it is depreciated by libxml-2.6.x : see xsldbg.h IN_LIBXML
  Sort the printing of breakpoints in order of breakpoint ID. 
    o Sorting can be disabled by defining XSLDBG_NO_SORTING.
    o required adding arrayListSet function 
    o required updating tests to take sorted breakpoints into account
    o sorting has not been used when running xsldbg as a thread to avoid side effects on qxsldbg and kxsldgb.  

Keith Isdale 30 Nov 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Update SAX usage to handle libxml-2.6.0: Usage of libxml-2.6.3 or the libxml module from GNOME cvs is 
	required to avoid segfaults due encoding problems in libxml
  Set encoding as UTF-8 in XML files used in automated tests
 
Keith Isdale 26 July 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Detect the lixbml version at run time rather than compile time, so that can use different
    XML entity handling code to suit the installed libxml

Keith Isdale 19 July 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Vesion 3.1.7
  Remove old method of finding line numbers from XML documents as it causes conflicts  
  Fix bug in "run' behavior, 
    o if the user issues the "run" command then always restart stylesheet and stop at the first valid LIBXSLT command. 
    o don't output result of processing XSLT script (user should use continue,then run if they want that)
  Remove extra "newlines" in test specifications which could give misleading test results
  Use of libxslt version >= 1.0.31, or < 1.0.29 is recomended, as version  1.0.29 - 1.0.30 have a bug that cause xsldbg to fail
  Win32 specific compiler fixes to suit changes made to libxml2.dll
     updated src/Makefile.msvc to make it more useful	
 
Keith Isdale 05-17 July 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>

    o if needed use glibtoolize not libtoolize
    o don't use -rpath in Makefile.am's
  Fix cause of crash with newer versions of libxml/libxslt when the -o command line argument is specified
  Handle change in libxml behaviour which stops breakpoints being set on XML data ( caused test10 to fail)

Keith Isdale 29 June 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Version 3.1.5
  Fix bug that can cause the warning message not to display when adding a existing template breakpoint
    - change test2 to suit
  xsldbg implementation note : no warning will be given for adding an existing template if xsldbg has 
	not yet reached the point where it can determine the templates that exist in the XSLT script.
	This is because xsldbg assigns a fake XSLT script URL to the template breakpoint in this scenario
	and then resolves the breakpoint to the requested location when possible.
  change semantics of gdb option
	o gdb option has a value of 1 by default
        o when --gdb is passed on the command the value of the "gdb option" is increased to flag 
	    that xsldbg should print out the extra information needed by kdbg 
  Documentation bug fixes

Keith Isdale 22 June 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
   Rename xsldbg.suse.8.1.spec to xsldbg.suse.8.0.spec
   Convert xsldbg.spec to be a GCC 3.2, i386, spec file 
   Minor code clean up get rid of some warnings
   Fix Ctrl-C handler so that at most two Ctrl-C's are required to abort xsldbg
   Enable gdb mode by default, and print extra GDB messages needed for KDbg when verbose mode is set :
	xsldbg --verbose --gdb ... 
    Otherwise it the extra messages are annoying
    Fix crash bug when adding a template breakpoint
    Started support for orphaned template breakpoints

Keith Isdale 15 June 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
   Fixed the specification for test2. All xsldbg automatic tests now pass  
   Update spec files to new vesion
   Updated configure.in, Makefile.am, spec files to make use of explicit specification of KDE, Qt and GMOME dir's (handy during RPM builds)
   Fixed KDE help centre docs to now they are found in help:/xsldbg/index.html.
   Added a xsldbg.desktop file for KDE which is placed into Development menu

Keith Isdale 1st,9th,14,15 June 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Version 3.1.4
  Completed implementation to support orphaned breakpoints for KDbg 1.9.0, and when in xsldbg is running in gdb compatbility mode
  This means that you can set a breakpoint at a line number for a file that has not been loaded yet 
    and xsldbg will activate the breakpoint when it can. An example xsldbg session is:
	$ xsldbg --shell --gdb
	<xsldbgprompt> b -l xsldoc.xsl 31
	<xsldbgprompt> source ../docs/en/xsldoc.xsl
	<xsldbgprompt> data ../docs/en/xsldoc.xml
	<xsldbgprompt> run
	...
	<xsldbgprompt> continue
	Breakpoint at file ../docs/en/xsldoc.xsl : line 31
    	<xsldbgprompt>
   Fixed the specification for and test10


Keith Isdale 31st May 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Version 3.1.3
  Implement suggestion made by Hannes
	- add "autorestart" option to xsldbg. When this boolean option is 
		set don't automaticly restart the stylesheet when debugging it 
		and the end is reached : disabled by default
  KDbg related bug fix: Add \032\032 to the Finished styesheet message so that KDbg knows when 
	    xsldbg has finished runing stylsheet

		

Keith Isdale 22nd May 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Minor documentation updates.
  First try a creating a xsldbg.spec (GCC 2.9.5 based systems ie Suse8.0) , comments welcome
  First try a creating a xsldbg.spec (GCC 3.x based systems ie Suse8.1) , comments welcome
  Fix bug stoping compilation using GCC 3.x

Keith Isdale 22nd May 2003 <keithisdale@gmail.com>

Keith Isdale 31 July 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
	Version 3.0.8
	Fixed bugs found by Robert JACOLIN, in
	    xsldbg.h check for either WITH_XSLT_DEBUGGER or WITH_DEBUGGER
	    documentation generation for KDE and GNOME2 try to install 
		the docbook files if possible so that only need to
	     to use the configure flags 
		--enable-kde-docs=yes
	     or 
		--enable-gnome-docs=yes
	     if you care about html versions of this style of documenation
     
	Bug watch!! if using autoconf version 2.5.X you may need to supply the 
	    aditional argument of 
	        --target=NONE 
	    to configure so that it will complete sucessfully.
	
	Bug watch!! I've updated Makefile.cvs to remove extra files that should
	    be built on each platorm. You may need to edit this if your build 
	    system does replace them correctly. 
	
	
Keith Isdale 31 July 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
	Version 3.0.7

	  result in an string have surrounding single quotes
	Fixed a segfault when using enable command that would occur 
		if an invalid line nunber was provided
	Fixed output of break command when errors occur on setting a template that already exist
	When setting break point appended mode name to the name of template 
		at which breakpoint occured. This is slight improvement it is
		hard to make sense to be made of breakpoints at very complex 
		templates ig 
		<xsl:template match="* | @" mode="modeName" />
	Added support for mode names in breakpoints and updated
		"show" command to suit
	
	
Keith Isdale 26 July 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>

Keith Isdale 25 July 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
	Version 3.0.1
	Added support for templates with a mode
	Break compatability with previous versions due to problems with 
	   templates and modeswith a QName and mode ie

	   documentation : See /docs/en/GNOME/gnome.docbook
	Update KDE style documentation
	Replace !xmlStrCmp with xmlStrEqual 
	Changed break command to 
		o Take two arguments a <TEMPLATE_NAME> <MODE_NAME>
		o Become aware of QName properties for first or second argument 
			eg 
			break xsl:templateName xsl:modeName
		o Only 
			break *
		  will cause breakpoints to be set on all templates
		o To set a breakpoint on the "*" template use
		        break \*
		   Other arguments that have a "*" will not be specialy treated 
		o If <TEMPLATE_NAME> or <MODE_NAME> does not have a non-local part of
			their QName then a match will be made on all items with the same 
	                local name. eg
			    break h1 
		  	will match on any template with 
			    o a template name of "h1" 
			    o a match that has "h1" in as its local name
	Modified tests to suit changes

	qxsldbg can run under cygwin/QT2/QT3. 

 		
	
Keith Isdale 1st/2nd/3rd Feb 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
   Version 2.1.5
   Changes needed to get xsldbg work under Cygwin
	Seems to require development versions of autoconf and automake
   	Moved definition of SOURCES in src/libqtnotifier/Makefile.am
   	Merged two definitions of EXTRA_DIST in docs/en/KDE/Makefile.am
	The files missing and ltmain.sh install-sh must be updated by
		your Cygwin installation

	Seems to require installation prefix of /usr NOT /usr/local
		configuration may take a while
	Avoided the creation of static version of xsldbgtest by 
	      using on -static libtool option when Cygwin is not used.
	      Achieved using a XSLDBG_STATIC_FLAGS macro in configure.in
		,src/Makefile.am  and tests/Makefile.am
	Avoided the use of readline when running tests (when --stdout
		option is used)
   All current tests pass
	
   Fixed detection of failed storage of the search dataBase. Print error
	message if there was a problem
	
   Removed dead files 
	xsldbgconf.h*

	
Keith Isdale 24rd Feb 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
   Version 2.1.4
   Created perl script to run most of the tests in tests directory
	This should be able to be reused/modified for platforms other than *nix
   Added stdout option so that all mesages are can be chosen to be sent to stdout
	This is needed to run WIN3232 tests. 
	Updated xsldoc.xsl, options.c, options.h to suit
   
   Created tests/runwin32.pl
   Most tests can now be run under WIN32 using perl and tests/runwin32.pl. But this
	requires Perl-5.6 or greater. At the moment the MSVC project files don't 
	build the test "executables"
   Added further details to tests in tests/*

	
Keith Isdale 23rd Feb 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
   Version 2.1.3
   Added support for output file to be specified as "file://" protocol URI

   Moved declaration of file related commands to debugXSL.h
   Added padantic configure option (configure.in) to choose padantic compiler options
   Converted the remainding strcmp calls to xmlStrCmp
   Stripped any double quotes given to system and public command. Otherwise
	it confusing as to why a entry is not found if quotes are supplied
   Simplify filesLoadCatalogs (files.c), updated files effected (xsldbg.c and  file_cmds.c)
   Updated docs/en/xsldoc.xml to suit changes
	
Keith Isdale 22th Feb 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>	
   Version 2.1.2		
   Applied patches by Justin
   Added searchresultspath option (OPTIONS_SEARCH_RESULTS_PATH), see setoption command
	This is now used by the search command. See search command
	Added function filesSearchResultsPath (files.c) to return value of 
	  path to be used for the results of searching. This is because 
	  the user may have the XSLT files stored outside thier "home" directory
   Updated "search" command in xsldoc.xml to 
   Fix guessing of stylesheet name and XML file name when URI's are used 
   Added tests to test2 to test the guessing of stylesheet and XML file names 
   Fixed filesEntityRef (files.c), set xsldbg:uri for all child nodes of entity when 
	entity has only a root node.
	
!Todo!
 cvs add tests/subdir tests/subdir/Makefile.am tests/subdir/test14.xsl tests/subdir/test14.xml tests/test13.xsl tests/test13.xml
	
Keith Isdale 20th Feb 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>	
  Version 2.1.1		
  Found the WIN32 requires output to be flushed before any input
	o added fflush to xslDbgWalkContinue (debugXSL.c)

  Updated docs/en/website with some screen shots of xsldbg running in 
	XEmacs and Quata+ and a running example for each.
  Added filesMoreFile (files.c) to print a file thus removing the dependancy
	on the "more" command
  Changed files_unix.c to use temporary files in the "/tmp/" directory. This
	is to avoid having more temp files than needed
	o modfied tempNames, filesPlatformInit, filesPlatformFree to suit 
	o fixed typo in files.c and make use of filesPlatormFree
  Changed searchQuery (search.c) to make use of filesMoreFile function (files.c)
	This means that the output will be correct when encoding other than UTF-8
	is used
  Found memory allocation of several strings to be wrong causing random seg faults
	increased memory alocation to allow for the '\0' termination
  Updated help_win32.c and help_unix.c to make use of filesMoreFile function (files.c)	
  Add more error messages to shellPrompt (debugXSL.c)
  Found xsldbg aborts when doc is unable to be parsed. Set xsldbg to stop
	
  Justin: Send a patch if you want to change help_riscos.c to make use of filesMoreFle
 
  cvs add docs/en/website/*.png
	
	
Keith Isdale 19th Feb 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>

  Changes requested to suit upcomming KDbg release 
     o Disabled the echoing enter commands in gdb mode
     o When printing expressions add "= " then <EXPRESSION> followed 
	by what <EXPRESSION> evaluates to
     o print current location as well for "where" command
     o disable printing of "Reached template ..." to terminal until 
	trace or walk command are being used
  Tried to make steup command more accurate. This is very tricky to
	get right :-) 
  Created Makefile.am's to create win32 distribution
  Added target dist_win32 to create distribution for WIN32 users of xsldbg
  Added #include of xsldbgthread.h in param_cmds.c to remove a warning
  Found and fixed bug in file name expansion ie converting "~" to <USERS_HOME_DIR>
	o created platform dependant function filesExpandName in files.h
	o updated xsldbg.c and debugXSL.c to make use of filesExpandName
	o updated files_unix.c, files_win32.c and files_riscos.c with 
	   suitable version of filesExpandName
 File name expansion now works on 
	command line parameters of 
  	  o --cd <PATH>,  <STYLESHEET> ,<XML_DATA_FILE> <OUTPUTFILE>
	xsldbg commands of 
  	  o source, data and output
 Updated docs/en/xsldoc.xml to suit these changes
 On my local system created win32_distcheck.sh to quickly setup links to
	check/compile a xsldbg zip release under WIN32 (Won't be distributed)

  Version 2.0.6
  Depreciated breakPointSetActiveBreakPoint and breakPointGetActiveBreakPoint
	They now do nothing, removes bug in printing current location and when gdb
	mode is enabled
	
Keith Isdale 10 Feb 2002 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
  Version 2.0.5	
  Copied Igor's MSVC project files to win32\dsp\
	As normal user may need to change paths for location of 
	  includes, libraries and dll's to suit your installation.
	xsldbg is now mainly a library but at this time can only be 
	built as a static library. Requires the def files for
	export definitions to be able to be built as a dll.
	TODO! Create script to autogenerate def file using sgml files 
	   created by GNOME documentation tool
  Test build under MSVC 5.0 - OK. Executable file size will be smaller than previous 
	releases ( about 100Kb )
  Found and fixes bug in "search" command. Abort if no stylesheet has been loaded
	before doing search
	Found "more" command in WIN32 refuses to accept file name of .\searchresult.txt
	  Added this problem to limitations. WIN32 users may need to use 
		"shell type .\searchresult.txt" instead
	TODO! Look at replacing more command.      
  Update docs/en/website/index.html and docs/en/website/win32_install.html
  Created config_riscos.h.in to automate riscos configuration creation
  Created win32/dsp/.cvsignore 
  Updated docs/en/search.xsl and docs/en/searchhtml.xsl.  
  Removed dead files : xsldbg.kdevprj  and xsldbg.kdevses

	XsldbgEvent. Then fill in the list of XsldbgEventData elements 
	 appropriate attributes for the message. 
	This means that the application does not know
 	about how xsldbg is implemented. All they see is the notification 
	messages. This is also a far easier method to maintain as previous
	method was very difficult to understand.

Fixed inconsitancies in src/*.h	
    o ensure that enums are declared that same way, made use of 
	enums rather that using int's and have a unique range of values
	(where possible). 
    o ensure that enums values are accesed via a temporary int variable. This
 	is to ensure there are no compiler problems. I've previous experienced
	problems where you can't do a switch on a enum value.
    o	Added enum types of
	  BreakPointTypeEnum, FileTypeEnum, WalkSpeedEnum, 
	  OptionTypeEnum, TraceModeEnum, CommandsEnum

    o ensure that each include file has the preamble needed for when
	a c++ compiler is used

    o fix spelling of "Return :" to "Returns :"
    o ensure that the return values are aligned vertically

	be consistant with rest of project. They now are 
		topDocument, tempDocument,topStylesheet
   o fixed spelling of getTemporarDoc to getTemporaryDoc
   o fixed logic of xsldbg.c so that when debugging stylesheets
	we start up in a xslDebugStatus of DEBUG_STOP
   o fixed spelling of xsldbgSleep to xslDbgSleep
   o ensure all functions have a fully described declaration
	near the start of most *.c files is the declations of
	its private functions

Updated docs/en/website/index.html
Fixed configure.in to generated GNOME docs if asked
Updated docs/en/GNOME/Makefile.am to try generate gtkdoc style docs but it is 
	still broken
	
	
Keith Isdale 4 Dec 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Fixed configure.in and all Makefile.am's so that they setup and 
   use LIBXSLT_PREFIX, LIBXML_PREFIX. and that all executions
   of xsldbg use these libraries at theses locations 
	
 Compiled with pandantic compiler settings and find errors reported	
 Fixed listTest.c and searchTest.c so that only minor warnings are 	
   generated upon thier compilation
 Fixed minor issues mostly to do with casts to (char*) or (xmlChar*)
   	
 Fix docs/en/Makefile.am so that xsldoc.txt is generated
 Commit to cvs	
 Fix ChangeLog so that is is consistant

 Keith Isdale 20 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Added file breakpoint/breakpointInternals.h to libxslt
   Put all the declarations of potential useful internal breakpoint functions 
   in 	breakpointInternals.h
 Added to the breakpoint API (breakpoint/breakpointInternals.h) the internal search 
	functions of :
  	     searchInit, searchFree, searchDoc, seachRootNode, 
	    searchBreakPointNode,  searchTemplateNode, searchCallStackNode
 Added to the breakpoint API (breakpoint/breakpoint.h)the public search 
	functions of :
   	 xslSeachEmpty, xslSearchSave, xslSeachAdd, xslFindNodesByQuery
 Changed Makefile.am in the root dir of libxslt so
     that the breakpoint API is only built if needed.
     Removed the usage of the WITH_DEBUGGER #defines in
	breakpoint directory.
 Fix many errors detected by even more pandatic compiler settings
 Added macros :
	    xmlStrLen, xmlStrCat, xmlStrCpy
   to xsldbg.h to handle (xmlChar*) input instead of (char*)
     They still end up calling  the standard string functions
 Removed the "root" command line parameter instead xsldbg automatically 
	stops and first xsl node found after stepping into stylesheet
 Fixed errors in logic for recovering when files can't be loaded
       in xsldbg.c main	
	

	
 Keith Isdale 19 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Added automatic replacement of '~' for $HOME environment variable value
         when using source and data commands
 Added xslEmptyBreakPoint to breakpoint API
 Did a trial run of importing breakpoint API implementation into 
    libxslt. Made small changes to header imports.
    Fixed xslHandleDebugger so it doesn't crash if its preconditions 
       are not met	
   Ported new xsltproc code into xsldbg.c
   Added xslDebugBreak to dbgmain.c 	
   Fix many minor errors detected by setting pandantic compiler flags
 Changed source and data commands so that a "run" is required after
      changing files, this makes if much simpler and more reliable
 Added test8 to run xsldbg on docbook.xsl
 Cleaned up breakpoint API source

	
	
 Keith Isdale 18 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Implemented  new breakpoint API changed 
	in libxslt breakpoint/dbgbreakpoint.c
	in libxslt breakpoint/breakpoint.h	
 Fixed crash when using arraylist

	
	
 Keith Isdale 17 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Add libxslt parameter commands ie addparam, delparam, showparam

	if provided	
 Upated xsldoc.xml
 Fixed libxslt/attributes.c so that xsl:attribute, and xsl:attribute-set works	
 Added test 5, 6, 7 all libxst intructions able to be stepped into are now covered	

	
 Keith Isdale 11 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Separated parameter storage from xsldbg.c and put into options.[ch]
 Added files.[ch] 
	 handles file interaction. But still uses xsldbg.c to do
        actual file parsing and loading	
 Added options.[ch] 
        handles storage and retrieval of xsldbg options such as stylesheet 
	 file name 
 Added	implementation for array list via arraylist.h, dbgarraylist.c
 Added tests for array list
 Added support for an unlimited number of libxslt parameters. But still
       use the hard limit of 8 parameters  for the moment	
 Added the ability to choose xml and stylesheet file from xsldbg prompt
 Made debugging default, if no parameters are given to xsldbg than it
      goes straight to xsldbg command prompt	


	
 Keith Isdale 10 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Reverted to orginal name for XSL_DEBUGGER definition

	
 Keith Isdale 9 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>

 Keith Isdale 3 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Version 0.6.4	
 Ported xsldbg to use  xmlNoNetExternalEntityLoader in libxml 
	(xsldbg.c is a rehash of /xsltproc/xsltproc.c in libxslt)
	
 Split breakpoint API into several small files of cohesive functions
	
 Change libxslt to supply blank implementation of breakpoint API which I 
   then override in xsldbg (see files src/dbg*.c)
   files affected in libxslt are
 	/configure.in, /Makefile.am, /breakpoints/*.[ch]  	

	Adapt /configure.in to abort if debugger support not built into libxslt

	
 Keith Isdale 1 Nov 2001 <keithisdale@gmail.com>
 Version 0.6.3	
 Changed xslDbgPrintTemplateNames so that the order of printing templates so
	it matches the order it is in file 

 Added tests directory and build a framework for automated testing
	see results directory for the intermediate outputs of testing
 Added function xslDebugGotControl to breakpoint API (see /breakpoint/dbgmain.c)
