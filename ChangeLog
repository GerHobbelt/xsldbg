  Added #include of xsldbgthread.h in param_cmds.c to remove a warning
  Found and fixed bug in file name expansion ie converting "~" to <USERS_HOME_DIR>
	o created platform dependant function filesExpandName in files.h
	o updated xsldbg.c and debugXSL.c to make use of filesExpandName
	o updated files_unix.c, files_win32.c and files_riscos.c with 
	   suitable version of filesExpandName
 File name expansion now works on 
	command line parameters of 
  	  o --cd <PATH>,  <STYLESHEET> ,<XML_DATA_FILE> <OUTPUTFILE>
	xsldbg commands of 
  	  o source, data and output

        o  Reversed the order of printing "frame stack" now prints the 
	   newest item at top of list
	
  Bug fixes 
	o added missing checks on several function's preconditions. Mainly missed checking
	   if pointer arguments were NULL
	o made several error messages consistant with rest of project
	o function xslDbgShellDelete -l option not deleting breakpoint
	
  Extended automatic command line tests to cover

Keith Isdale 10 Feb 2002 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au
  Version 2.0.5	
  Copied Igor's MSVC project files to win32\dsp\
	As normal user may need to change paths for location of 
	  includes, libraries and dll's to suit your installation.
	xsldbg is now mainly a library but at this time can only be 
	built as a static library. Requires the def files for
	export definitions to be able to be built as a dll.
	TODO! Create script to autogenerate def file using sgml files 
	   created by GNOME documentation tool
  Test build under MSVC 5.0 - OK. Executable file size will be smaller than previous 
	releases ( about 100Kb )
  Found and fixes bug in "search" command. Abort if no stylesheet has been loaded
	before doing search
	Found "more" command in WIN32 refuses to accept file name of .\searchresult.txt
	  Added this problem to limitations. WIN32 users may need to use 
		"shell type .\searchresult.txt" instead
	TODO! Look at replacing more command.

	XsldbgEvent. Then fill in the list of XsldbgEventData elements 
	 appropriate attributes for the message. 
	This means that the application does not know
 	about how xsldbg is implemented. All they see is the notification 
	messages. This is also a far easier method to maintain as previous
	method was very difficult to understand.

Keith Isdale 7 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
  Created KDE style API documentation headers in docs/en/KDE/src
	updated Makefile.am to suit. Will need to merge these with 
	the main source after the first beta :-(
  Gave up on GNOME documentation for the moment. Too many difficult 
	errors being generated by gtkdoc-mktmpl and gtkdoc-mkhtml
  Updated configure.in to abort if GNOME docs are have been requested 
	as they don't work.
  Added a "very-clean" target to commonly "clean"ed directories
  Checked xsldbg works with new version of libxslt without patches. Yes!!	
	Found libxslt that it didn't roll over to new version number. Arg!!
  Fixed "cd" command whose "-t" option was not changing to template
	node when it was found
  Fixed xsldbg2kde.xsl/commands.xsl to generate links to commands 
  Fixed xsldbg2kde.xsl to gererate comments properly ie four spaces and 
	an emphasis

	start stylesheet in with a xslDebugStatus of DEBUG_STOP
  Version 0.8.8
	
	
Keith Isdale 6 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
Fixed inconsitancies in src/*.h	
    o ensure that enums are declared that same way, made use of 
	enums rather that using int's and have a unique range of values
	(where possible). 
    o ensure that enums values are accesed via a temporary int variable. This
 	is to ensure there are no compiler problems. I've previous experienced
	problems where you can't do a switch on a enum value.
    o	Added enum types of
	  BreakPointTypeEnum, FileTypeEnum, WalkSpeedEnum, 
	  OptionTypeEnum, TraceModeEnum, CommandsEnum
    o ensure that all references to "break point[s]" use the same spelling
    o ensure that each include file has the preamble needed for when
	a c++ compiler is used
    o fix spelling errors of the word sucessful 	
    o fix spelling of "Return :" to "Returns :"
    o ensure that the return values are aligned vertically
    o added #define for	URISEPARATORCHAR to xsldbg.h which is to be 
	used by files.h when guessing what the stylesheet name is 
    o fixed guessStylesheetHelper* to use the URISEPARATORCHAR if 
	needed 
    o fixed the spelling of guessStyleSheetHelper* to 
	 guessStylesheetHelper*
   o fixed spelling of top_doc, temp_doc and top_style in files to 
	be consistant with rest of project. They now are 
		topDocument, tempDocument,topStylesheet
   o fixed spelling of getTemporarDoc to getTemporaryDoc
   o fixed logic of xsldbg.c so that when debugging stylesheets
	we start up in a xslDebugStatus of DEBUG_STOP
   o fixed spelling of xsldbgSleep to xslDbgSleep
   o ensure all functions have a fully described declaration
	near the start of most *.c files is the declations of
	its private functions
		
	
	
Keith Isdale 5 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
Updated docs/en/website/index.html
Fixed configure.in to generated GNOME docs if asked

	still broken
	
	
Keith Isdale 4 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
 Fixed configure.in and all Makefile.am's so that they setup and 
   use LIBXSLT_PREFIX, LIBXML_PREFIX. and that all executions
   of xsldbg use these libraries at theses locations 
	
 Compiled with pandantic compiler settings and find errors reported	
 Fixed listTest.c and searchTest.c so that only minor warnings are 	
   generated upon thier compilation

 Fix docs/en/Makefile.am so that xsldoc.txt is generated
 Commit to cvs	
 Fix ChangeLog so that is is consistant

   Put all the declarations of potential useful internal breakpoint functions 
   in 	breakpointInternals.h
 Added to the breakpoint API (breakpoint/breakpointInternals.h) the internal search 
	functions of :

	(xsldbg.c is a rehash of /xsltproc/xsltproc.c in libxslt)
	
 Split breakpoint API into several small files of cohesive functions
	
 Change libxslt to supply blank implementation of breakpoint API which I 
   then override in xsldbg (see files src/dbg*.c)
   files affected in libxslt are
 	/configure.in, /Makefile.am, /breakpoints/*.[ch]  	

	Adapt /configure.in to abort if debugger support not built into libxslt

	
 Keith Isdale 1 Nov 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
