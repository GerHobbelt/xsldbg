	normal *.h files
   Created new file xslbreakpoint_2.h to temporarily hold the API
	docs for the breakpoint related functions
   Created xslcallpoint.h merged KDE and GNOME call stack related
	API docs into it

	docs into it	
   Updated docs/en/GNOME/Makefile.am , docs/en/KDE/Makefile.am 
	to suit new files

   Fixed logic of starting xslDebugStatus again!! 
   Changed configure.in to enable GNOME __or__ KDE style docs to be build
	a one time
   Added more entries to FAQ in the website documentation
   Fixed the website docs it had used "cont" as the short cut to continue
	instead of "c"
   Fixed xsldoc.dtd mixed content must have #pcdata first 
	and the errors that showed up in xsldoc.xml as a result

Keith Isdale 7 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
  Created KDE style API documentation headers in docs/en/KDE/src
	updated Makefile.am to suit. Will need to merge these with 
	the main source after the first beta :-(
  Gave up on GNOME documentation for the moment. Too many difficult 
	errors being generated by gtkdoc-mktmpl and gtkdoc-mkhtml
  Updated configure.in to abort if GNOME docs are have been requested 
	as they don't work.
  Added a "very-clean" target to commonly "clean"ed directories
  Checked xsldbg works with new version of libxslt without patches. Yes!!	
	Found libxslt that it didn't roll over to new version number. Arg!!
  Fixed "cd" command whose "-t" option was not changing to template
	node when it was found
  Fixed xsldbg2kde.xsl/commands.xsl to generate links to commands 
  Fixed xsldbg2kde.xsl to gererate comments properly ie four spaces and 
	an emphasis
  Fixed dbgsearch.c and search.dtd to generate import and includes properly
  Fixed logic in xsldbg.c if option DEBUG_SHELL is set then alway
	start stylesheet in with a xslDebugStatus of DEBUG_STOP
  Version 0.8.8
	
	
Keith Isdale 6 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
Fixed inconsitancies in src/*.h	
    o ensure that enums are declared that same way, made use of 
	enums rather that using int's and have a unique range of values
	(where possible). 
    o ensure that enums values are accesed via a temporary int variable. This
 	is to ensure there are no compiler problems. I've previous experienced
	problems where you can't do a switch on a enum value.
    o	Added enum types of
	  BreakPointTypeEnum, FileTypeEnum, WalkSpeedEnum, 
	  OptionTypeEnum, TraceModeEnum, CommandsEnum
    o ensure that all references to "break point[s]" use the same spelling
    o ensure that each include file has the preamble needed for when
	a c++ compiler is used
    o fix spelling errors of the word sucessful 	
    o fix spelling of "Return :" to "Returns :"
    o ensure that the return values are aligned vertically
    o added #define for	URISEPARATORCHAR to xsldbg.h which is to be 
	used by files.h when guessing what the stylesheet name is 
    o fixed guessStylesheetHelper* to use the URISEPARATORCHAR if 
	needed 
    o fixed the spelling of guessStyleSheetHelper* to 
	 guessStylesheetHelper*
   o fixed spelling of top_doc, temp_doc and top_style in files to 
	be consistant with rest of project. They now are 
		topDocument, tempDocument,topStylesheet
   o fixed spelling of getTemporarDoc to getTemporaryDoc
   o fixed logic of xsldbg.c so that when debugging stylesheets
	we start up in a xslDebugStatus of DEBUG_STOP
   o fixed spelling of xsldbgSleep to xslDbgSleep
   o ensure all functions have a fully described declaration
	near the start of most *.c files is the declations of
	its private functions
		
	
	
Keith Isdale 5 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
Updated docs/en/website/index.html
Fixed configure.in to generated GNOME docs if asked
Updated docs/en/GNOME/Makefile.am to try generate gtkdoc style docs but it is 
	still broken
	
	
Keith Isdale 4 Dec 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
 Fixed configure.in and all Makefile.am's so that they setup and 
   use LIBXSLT_PREFIX, LIBXML_PREFIX. and that all executions
   of xsldbg use these libraries at theses locations 
	
 Compiled with pandantic compiler settings and find errors reported	
 Fixed listTest.c and searchTest.c so that only minor warnings are 	
   generated upon thier compilation
 Fixed minor issues mostly to do with casts to (char*) or (xmlChar*)
   	
 Fix docs/en/Makefile.am so that xsldoc.txt is generated
 Commit to cvs	
 Fix ChangeLog so that is is consistant

 Added file breakpoint/breakpointInternals.h to libxslt
   Put all the declarations of potential useful internal breakpoint functions 
   in 	breakpointInternals.h
 Added to the breakpoint API (breakpoint/breakpointInternals.h) the internal search 
	functions of :
  	     searchInit, searchFree, searchDoc, seachRootNode, 
	    searchBreakPointNode,  searchTemplateNode, searchCallStackNode
 Added to the breakpoint API (breakpoint/breakpoint.h)the public search 
	functions of :
   	 xslSeachEmpty, xslSearchSave, xslSeachAdd, xslFindNodesByQuery

     that the breakpoint API is only built if needed.
     Removed the usage of the WITH_DEBUGGER #defines in
	breakpoint directory.
 Fix many errors detected by even more pandatic compiler settings
 Added macros :
	    xmlStrLen, xmlStrCat, xmlStrCpy
   to xsldbg.h to handle (xmlChar*) input instead of (char*)
     They still end up calling  the standard string functions

   Ported new xsltproc code into xsldbg.c
   Added xslDebugBreak to dbgmain.c

	 file name

       use the hard limit of 8 parameters  for the moment

 Made debugging default, if no parameters are given to xsldbg than it
      goes straight to xsldbg command prompt	


	
 Keith Isdale 10 Nov 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
 Reverted to orginal name for XSL_DEBUGGER definition

	
 Keith Isdale 9 Nov 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>

 Keith Isdale 3 Nov 2001< k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
 Version 0.6.4	
 Ported xsldbg to use  xmlNoNetExternalEntityLoader in libxml 
	(xsldbg.c is a rehash of /xsltproc/xsltproc.c in libxslt)
	
 Split breakpoint API into several small files of cohesive functions
	
 Change libxslt to supply blank implementation of breakpoint API which I 
   then override in xsldbg (see files src/dbg*.c)
   files affected in libxslt are
 	/configure.in, /Makefile.am, /breakpoints/*.[ch]  	

	Adapt /configure.in to abort if debugger support not built into libxslt

	
 Keith Isdale 1 Nov 2001 <k_isdale@tpg.com.au>
