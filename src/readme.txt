There are several references to USE_KDE_DOCS and USE_GNOME_DOCS, BUILD_DOCS
 They are used to build KDE and GNOME API documentation.  

The header files for KDE (docs/en/KDE/src/*.h) and the API docs (docs/en/apidocs/*.html) are  part of the cvs 
 archive. This is because I'm still having some trouble with GNOME style docs.
