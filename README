See docs/en/website/index.html and docs/en/plain/index.html for latest information 
  
nb: docs/en/website/index.html includes a quick tutorial about using xsldbg

For all users of xsldbg and KDE style documentation you will need to set your KDEDIR and QTDIR paths eg:
  export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt4
  export KDEDIR=/opt/kde4

This package can be built on *nix and Windows.

If found tools xslt-config and xml2-config will be used to set
library and compliler flags, otherwise:
  $LIBXML_PREFIX must be set to the location of libxml2
  $LIBXSLT_PREFIX must be set to the location of libxslt
  $ICONV_PREFIX must be set to the location of iconv

To change the xsldbg installation path see "INSTALL_PREFIX" in xsldbg.pri

For unix run for (*nix):
  qmake
  make
  make install # may require sudo 

for Windows (MSVC) :
  qmake
  nmake
  nmake install
then install xsldbg's catalog.xml via running
  createcatalog.bat

The tests and results directories are only used under *nix platforms and are not built see test/README.
if you want to run them :
    cd tests
    perl runtests.pl
