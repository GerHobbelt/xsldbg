nb: docs/en/website/index.html includes a quick tutorial about using xsldbg

The MSVC project files are in win32/dsp/

For WIN32 users using tmake you will need to set
  LIBXML_PREFIX must be set to the location of libxml
  LIBXSLT_PREFIX  must be set to the location of libxslt
  ICONV_PREFIX must be set to the location of iconv

  Use src/xsldbg.pro to create xsldbg.exe 

  If you want to create qxsldbg you will need to use  
	src/libxsldbg/libxsldbg.pro to create xsldbg.lib
	src/libqtnotifier/libqtnotifier.pro to create qtnofier.lib

The tests and results directories are only used under *nix platforms
