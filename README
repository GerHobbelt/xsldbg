  export KDEDIR=/opt/kde4

This package can be built on *nix and Windows.

If found tools xslt-config and xml2-config will be used to set
library and compliler flags, otherwise:
  $LIBXML_PREFIX must be set to the location of libxml2
  $LIBXSLT_PREFIX must be set to the location of libxslt
  $ICONV_PREFIX must be set to the location of iconv

To change the xsldbg installation path see "INSTALL_PREFIX" in xsldbg.pri

For unix run for (*nix):
  qmake
  make
  make install # may require sudo 
  
The provided xsldbg.spec can be used to create a RPM, note by default Qt4 is used in xsldbg.spec. Usage example
   rpmbuild -tb xsldbg-4.5.0.tar.gz


for Windows (MSVC) :
  qmake
  nmake
  nmake install
then install xsldbg's catalog.xml via running
  createcatalog.bat

The tests and results directories are only used under *nix platforms and are not built see test/README.
if you want to run them :
    cd tests
