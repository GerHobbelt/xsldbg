This package requiries
* Qt 4.x or Qt5.x development libraries/headers to be present
* libxslt and libxml2 libraries/headers to be present.

As example install prerequisites on OpenSuse Linux for Qt4 build of xsldbg
* sudo zypper install rpmbuild patterns-openSUSE-devel_qt4 patterns-openSUSE-devel_basis patterns-openSUSE-devel_C_C++ libxslt-devel libxml2-devel libxslt libxml2

Documentation
* To regenerate docbook documentation saxon version 6 must be in path. See docs/en/en.pro
* docs/en/website/index.html includes a quick tutorial about using xsldbg
* docs/en/website/index.html and docs/en/plain/index.html for latest information 
* to add docbook DTD support to catalog on Linux use command like: sudo  xmlcatalog -v --add nextCatalog '' "file:///usr/share/xml/docbook/schema/dtd/4.5/catalog.xml" /etc/xml/catalog
* for users of xsldbg's KDE style documentation you will need to set your KDEDIR and QTDIR paths eg:
  export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt4
  export KDEDIR=/opt/kde4

This package can be built on *nix and Windows.

If found tools xslt-config and xml2-config will be used to set
library and compliler flags, otherwise:
  $LIBXML_PREFIX must be set to the location of libxml2
  $LIBXSLT_PREFIX must be set to the location of libxslt
  $ICONV_PREFIX must be set to the location of iconv

For unix run for (*nix):
  qmake
  make
  make install # may require sudo and it will update the System's XML catalog to include xsldbg's DTDs.
  
The provided xsldbg.spec can be used to create a RPM, note by default Qt4 is used in xsldbg.spec. Usage example
   rpmbuild -tb xsldbg-4.5.0.tar.gz

Currenty no testing has been done using version 4.5.0 on Windows(MSVC) though the following should work if Qt and other dependencies are setup correctly:
  qmake
  nmake
  nmake install
then if wished install xsldbg's catalog.xml via running
  createcatalog.bat

For WIN32 you must ensure that %LIBXML_PREFIX%\lib, %LIBXSLT_PREFIX%\lib, %ICONV_PREFIX%\lib has been added to your %PATH% before starting xsldbg.exe. It is recommended that you install xsldbg into c:\xsldbg 

If on *nix and xsldbg is built in same directory as source tests can be run. For details see tests/README. Note currently 'test10' is known to fail at moment.
If you want to run test then:
    cd tests
    perl runtests.pl

For WIN32 user you will need to set several environment variables
 XSLDBG_PREFIX must to set to the location of xsldbg cvs checkout or the
                directory where you extracted the libxsldbg.zip AND libqtnotifier.zip
  LIBXML_PREFIX must be set to the location of libxml
  LIBXSLT_PREFIX  must be set to the location of libxslt
  ICONV_PREFIX must be set to the location of iconv

  You must ensure that %LIBXML_PREFIX%\lib, %LIBXSLT_PREFIX%\lib, %ICONV_PREFIX%\lib has been added to your %PATH% before starting qxsldbg.exe. Unless you yave copied the dll's found in these directories into you qxsldbg the \qxsldbg
  It is recommended that you install qxsldbg into c:\qxsldbg

To create dist packages in *nix the following must be present, see the makedist.sh script
* tar
* bzip2
* zip
